              <h4>üõ†Ô∏è Crafting Digital Experiences:</h4>
              <p>I fell in love with coding in 2022, and since then, 
                I've been on a mission to make the digital world a more 
                inviting place. My focus is on turning ideas into visually 
                appealing and functional websites.</p>

              <h4>üñ•Ô∏è Tools of Innovation</h4>
              <p>In my toolkit, you'll find a proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, 
                and JavaScript, along with a mastery of frameworks like 
                React, Bootsrap, Tailwind and some other CSS libraries. I love tackling challenges, 
                be it optimizing for performance, ensuring seamless 
                responsiveness, or architecting elegant solutions to 
                complex problems.</p>

              <p>I believe in the power of simplicity and functionality. 
                Whether it's a startup project or a redesign, I enjoy 
                collaborating to marry great design with smooth functionality.</p>

              <p>When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me playing games, 
                exploring the 
                digital frontier, experimenting with the latest design trends, 
                and contributing to open-source projects. I believe in the power 
                of community and continuous learning to stay ahead in this 
                dynamic field.</p>

              <p>I so much love playing Games when I am less busy 
                and I think it helps me to recover from stress and also
                 boost my thinking strength</p>
